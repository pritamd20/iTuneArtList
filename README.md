iPhone Application (Tested for iOS 6 +)

Simple iPhone application demonstrating JSON parsing and Lazy loading 

Master detail application 

Master
- added UISearch bar to UINavigation Item 
    - Easy access , stays on top all the time 
- Table view with default cells 
    - Simple to use and quick development. 

- Set title to search term , So back button in detail screen will show this up    
    
Detail 

- Title set to tack name 
   - The detail view is about particular track , So its good to show track name on top like heading 
   

Improvement
- Network reachability alerts  
- Invaild search term alerts
- Error alerts for data or connection 
- Swipe cell to add a track to fav
- Fav list (local)

iPad app devlopment 

Can develope with split view controller. Need to add search bar in master view since adding search bar to navigation item (as in current app ) will not work. Since detail view is visible as soon as app is opend the default UILabel titles will show on screen, need to handal it.
